Monitoring and reporting plays a vital role in managing large-scale networks. In line with this point of view, Juniper has been working towards making the JUNOS devices more programmable and easily manageable. Our project aims at developing a desktop/mobile chat application (say Juniper IManage) that will use the upcoming and existing features in JUNOS manageability namely Junos-PyEZ and Juniper JVision. 
Junos-PyEZ is a python library that enables client applications to remotely manage and automate JUNOS devices. We are planning to use this package for sending commands to the devices using PyEZ and displaying the output to the user.
Juniper jVision is an architecture for high frequency export of  telemetry data from Juniper equipment. We will use this package for displaying the device status and health report on the main chat window.
